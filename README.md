# Education Platform

This is a web application created with React. It presents all the courses available and a list of teachers.

It is also possible to navigate to a detail page for the selected course with more detailed information about the course. The same applies to the teachers, there is a detailed page that shows information about the teacher and the areas of competence.

There is also a page for entering new courses and new teachers.

The application works in all modern browsers and is usable in different screen sizes and on different devices.

## Techniques/methodologies
